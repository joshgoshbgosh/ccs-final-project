Glow


Glow which stands for Generated Log Of Wellbeing is an app designed to help the everyday family caregiver.  Giving the ability to create a patient or patients and upload health information and prescription information to help keep track of medication intake by documenting each scheduled intake with a time stamp and comments of patients experience.  Glow also gives the ability to have secondary caregiver accounts outside of the primary caregiver account allowing the primary caregiver to select a registered secondary caregiver to link to a specific patent for providing care.   Glow also provides notifications for the primary caregiver when the secondary caregiver gives a scheduled dose of a prescription providing the time stamp, id of prescription and all comments documented for that specific dose which also is saved in the prescription history which is provided for the primary caregiver to have to look back on if needed.  Primary caregiver may also remove secondary caregiver from linking to patient which secondary caregiver will no longer have access to.

Motivation

My dad is an Alzheimer Patient and my mom takes care of him.  My dad needs 24 hour care for everything.  My mom takes care of my dad at home but he use to be in a care facility and due to a organizational mistake he was not given his medication on several occasions which ultimately caused him to have some issues because of that.  So I felt like this app would be helpful for someone who was in as situation where they had to take care of a loved one at home.
